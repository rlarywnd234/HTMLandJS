    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr class="Left_liner">
    <p>"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" is a science fiction novel by Philip K.Dick, first published in 1968.<br>
        Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the story revolves around Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter tasked with "retiring" rogue androids that have escaped to Earth from distant off-world colonies.
        The novel explores themes of identity, empathy, and the nature of humanity in a world where technology blurs the line between human and artificial intelligence. In this future society, 
        owning a living animal is considered a status symbol, as most real animals have become extinct due to radiation from World War Terminus. 
        To compensate, people keep mechanical animals, known as "electric sheep". As Deckard hunts down the androids, he questions what it means to be human and the morality of his actions. 
        The story delves into the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence, asking whether empathy and emotions are exclusive to humans or if they can be programmed into machines.
