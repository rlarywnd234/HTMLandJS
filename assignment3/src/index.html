    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr class="Left_liner" />
    <p>
      "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" is a science fiction novel by Philip K.Dick, first
      published in 1968.<br />
      Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the story revolves around Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter
      tasked with "retiring" rogue androids that have escaped to Earth from distant off-world
      colonies. The novel explores themes of identity, empathy, and the nature of humanity in a
      world where technology blurs the line between human and artificial intelligence. In this
      future society, owning a living animal is considered a status symbol, as most real animals
      have become extinct due to radiation from World War Terminus. To compensate, people keep
      mechanical animals, known as "electric sheep". As Deckard hunts down the androids, he
      questions what it means to be human and the morality of his actions. The story delves into the
      philosophical implications of artificial intelligence, asking whether empathy and emotions are
      exclusive to humans or if they can be programmed into machines.

    <h2>A Literary Analysis</h2>
    <hr class="Left_liner" />
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Acceptance vs. Selectivity</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Dick explores hypocrisy through Mercerism, a belief system promoting empathy. Yet, its
        followers are exclusive, rejecting marginalized individuals like chickenheads. Despite their
        empathy, chickenheads, victims of World War Terminus radiation, are barred from migrating to
        Mars or integrating into society. Ironically, John Isidore, a chickenhead, exhibits profound
        empathy. When he presents a living spider, prized in a world of extinct animals, to
        androids, they mutilate it. Isidore, despite his cognitive limitations, euthanizes the
        spider to end its suffering, prioritizing compassion over profit. His action highlights the
        irony of Mercerism's teachings. Despite being excluded from society, Isidore embodies true
        empathy, challenging societal norms. Through his character, Dick critiques the hypocrisy
        inherent in Mercerism's selective empathy and societal exclusivity.

      <dt><strong>Truth vs. Fiction</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Dick also delves into the deception surrounding Mercerism, a religion aiming to unify
        humanity through empathy and mood organs, connecting individuals to a collective
        consciousness. The mood organs underscore the divide between reality and illusion. Users
        enter a virtual reality via the empathy box, experiencing events with real-world
        consequences. However, revelations expose Mercer as a fraud, his image fabricated by
        Hollywood. Despite this, Mercerism persists, offering solace in an increasingly artificial
        world. Mercer, though exposed, remains a messianic figure, uniting humanity under a
        spiritual guise. Rick Deckard, grappling with empathy towards androids, confronts Mercer,
        who acknowledges the hypocrisy but urges him to continue hunting. This underscores the
        existential struggle of being human in a digital age, where authenticity is scarce and
        empathy is a rare commodity.

      <br />

      <dt><strong>Reality vs. Artificiality</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Dick also examines the blurred distinction between living and nonliving entities. William
        Mercer propagates the belief that empathy distinguishes humans from androids, attributing
        value to life. However, androids challenge this notion by experiencing empathetic emotions
        themselves. For instance, during Rick Deckard's hunt for androids, he encounters Roy Baty,
        who exhibits anguish when Deckard shoots Irmgard Baty. Deckard observes Roy's love for her,
        indicating a form of empathy. Additionally, while androids prioritize self-preservation,
        they also show concern for each other's well-being. In contrast, humans are conditioned to
        lack empathy for androids, leading to a decline in their own emotional capacity. Phil Resch
        exemplifies this by killing androids without remorse, deriving pleasure from it. Similarly,
        Deckard's pursuit of androids stems from self-interest rather than empathy. He seeks
        bounties to afford real animals, enhancing his social status, devoid of genuine concern for
        others.

      <dt><strong>Conclusion</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Ultimately, the novel delves into humanity's quest for significance in a decaying world,
        where empathy emerges as the primary unifying force. Dick explores various secondary themes,
        such as the dichotomy between reality and artificiality, individual versus collective
        desires, and the struggle between truth and fiction. These themes underscore the hypocrisy
        underlying people's efforts to preserve unity. He suggests that a shared belief system is
        essential for humanity's survival, regardless of its validity. Characters often act in ways
        contrary to the tenets of their religion, yet find solace in it amid bleak circumstances.
        Despite knowing its falsehoods, they cling to hope offered by these principles, which have
        become their reality.

    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <hr class="Left_liner" />
    <p>
      The backstory of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" originates from Philip K. Dick's
      research for his novel "The Man in the High Castle". While delving into diaries seized after
      World War II, Dick encountered accounts of unimaginable atrocities committed by individuals
      devoid of empathy. These experiences led him to conceptualize beings lacking empathy as
      "androids," setting the stage for his exploration of empathy as a central theme in his novel.
      In these diaries, Dick came across a chilling entry where a Nazi officer complained about
      being kept awake by the cries of starving children, viewing their suffering as a mere
      inconvenience. This lack of empathy struck Dick profoundly, prompting him to contemplate the
      essence of humanity and empathy. This exploration of empathy forms the crux of "Do Androids
      Dream of Electric Sheep?" as Dick delves into the nature of empathy and its significance in
      defining humanity. The novel revolves around the blurred line between humans and androids,
      questioning what it truly means to be empathetic and whether empathy is essential for being
      considered a living being. The protagonist, Rick Deckard, embarks on a journey that challenges
      his understanding of empathy and his own humanity as he encounters androids who may possess
      empathetic capabilities. Through Deckard's experiences, Dick prompts readers to reflect on the
      complexities of empathy and its role in shaping our perceptions of ourselves and others.
